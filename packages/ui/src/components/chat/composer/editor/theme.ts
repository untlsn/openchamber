/**
 * Every device keeps `drawSelection()` but shows the NATIVE selection through

 *
 * - iOS attaches its selection handles (the draggable pins after a
 *   double-tap) to the *visible* native selection, and `drawSelection()`
 *   hides it with `.cm-line ::selection { background: transparent
 *   !important }`, so the handles never appear and range selection is
 *   undiscoverable.
 * - The painted selection layer sits *behind* the content, so any token with
 *   its own background — inline code, code fences — covers it completely and
 *   the selection is invisible inside those spans. The native selection
 *   paints over element backgrounds.
 *
 * Dropping `drawSelection()` entirely is NOT an option: without it CodeMirror
 * clears the `nativeSelectionHidden` facet and starts enforcing cursor
 * association on the native selection while typing in wrapped text —
 * programmatic selection moves that iOS answers with severe input lag (each
 * one also resets the keyboard's autocorrect context). Typing must stay on
 * the drawn-selection code path; only the paint changes.
 *
 * Both rules below fight `drawSelection()`'s own `Prec.highest` theme, so
 * they carry `!important` and one class more specificity
 * (`.cm-content .cm-line` vs its `.cm-line`) to win regardless of style
 * mount order. The painted selection layer is hidden rather than removed —
 * two highlights would otherwise stack.
